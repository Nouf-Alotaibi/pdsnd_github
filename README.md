### Project Title
Udacity-bikeshare-project

### Description
This project is part of the prerequiste to completing Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program. The project involves using python to analyze bikeshare data from three cities (Chicago, New York City and Washington) in US. The dataset contains data for the first six months of 2017. For the analysis, Pandas Dataframe and Time module for time analysis were used.

The following are questions that were answered through analysis of the data by prompting the user for choice input: A) Which city to analyse out of Chicago, New York city and Washington? B) What particular month to analyse from January to June? or All. C) What particular day of week to be analysed from Monday to Sunday? or All

Statistics results that were displayed includes: A) The most pouplar month. B) The most popular day of week. C) The most popular start hour. D) The most popular Start and End Station. E) The most frequent Start to End Station combination. F) The total travel time and average travel time. G) The counts of user types and gender if any. H) The earliest, most recent and most common birth year. I) The first five individual trip data, if needed and more data if required.

### Files used
Files used are 3 CSV files containing bikeshare data for Chicago, New york City and Washington. The files are chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv

### Credits
I was able to complete this project by combining what I learnt from the Udacity course and by using python documentation. I used Chatgpt and stackoverflow to solve the code errors I encountered.
